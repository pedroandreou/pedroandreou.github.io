								</h2>  
								<p>The main idea of my game is based on Greek mythology; however, I have taken some artistic
									freedom in changing the original story-line. As the original story goes, King Odysseus of Ithaca
									was married to Penelope. At the end of the Trojan War, Odysseus started his journey back
									home but was believed by many to have died en route. Penelope, however, knew it in her
									heart that her husband was still alive.
									Tradition at the time had it that should a king die, his wife was to remarry. However, as
									Penelope did not believe her husband to be dead, she was holding off as long as possible. As
									the story goes, Odysseus took ten years to make it back home, as he had upset Poseidon, the
									god of the sea, by blinding his son.
									In my story, I replaced Odysseus the king of Ithaca, with the Spartan King and warrior,
									Leonidas. That is because Leonidas is a much more famous character, that has been popularized by Hollywood.
									The game has got many sounds which catch the player’s attention and enhance user experience. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Gameplay</h2>
								<p>The hero of my game is a Spartan warrior whose mission is to collect 11 black soups so that
									the gate to the basement opens. For each soup that he collects, we can hear him eating, but
									when collecting the last one, the ”This is Sparta” song will play.
									In trying to collect all the soups, the warrior will find three hazards on his way, and if he
									touches any of them, he will die with the game terminating. However, if he makes it to the
									basement, he will find a key on a barrel. If he collects the key, the ”key sound” effect will
									play, and the background music will change from Dragon Ball Z’s music to New Zealand’s
									Haka. By having the keys in his possession, he will be able to open the door and get into the
									ship to get on his way to the church (where Penelope is said to be marrying another)</p>

									 </a>
								</h2>
								<p>My console Drone simulator has been extended to GUI using JavaFX
									library.
									Through the application, the user must be able to interact with it by adding various types of
									Drones, Obstacles, loading or saving an arena and be able to read the games’ information and
									exit the game</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/droneSimulator01.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h2 class="major">Gameplay</h2>
								<p>ThanosDrone is the strongest drone, HulkDrone is weaker and SuperDrone the weakest.
									In more details, the HulkDrone is the green one, ThanosDrone is the black and white one
									and the Super drone is the blue one. There are 2 types of obstacles, the normal obstacle,
									and the fire obstacle. The main difference between them is that the fire obstacle flies unlike
									the normal obstacle which never changes position and stays static. In addition, both
									obstacles can turn ThanosDrone into HulkDrone and destroy the SuperDrone. However,
									HulkDrone cannot be destroyed by normal obstacle but rather just bounces on it and can
									eliminate the fire obstacle</p>

									 </a>
								</h2>
								<p>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is an internet standard communication protocol for
									electronic mail transmission 1 . It is used to send and receive emails between two parties. To
									achieve this, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is used which allows user to establish a
									TCP connection on local port 25 between SMTP client and server. This would allow the
									client to send a series of commands, the server to reply with the corresponding responses and
									then, store the email’s data message in a txt file representing the recipient’s email</p>

								<h2 class="major">Overview
									<a href="https://github.com/pedroandreou/Spartan-Warrior-Android-Game">
										<i class="fa fa-github fa-2x"></i>
									 </a>
								</h2>
								<p>The main idea of my game is based on Greek mythology. The hero of my game is a Spartan
									warrior whose mission is to reach as many levels as his can. This can happen only by having
									in his possession a key which will be used to open the door for reaching the next level. However,
									the way to glory will not be that easy as hazards will appear through his way and if he touches
									any of them, he will firstly lose health and then dies with the game terminating. For each
									soup that he collects, we can hear him eating and the health increases. The game has got many
									sounds and background music which catch the player’s attention and enhance user experience</p>
								<h2 class="major">Gameplay</h2>
								<p>The game consists of four activities. The first one is the menu which has three options for the
									user that can choose from. If the user chooses “Start”, then the game will start playing.
									However, if he loses, then he will be asked to submit his credentials which will be stored in the
									firebase along with his score and finally, he will be sent back to the main Menu. The option
									“High score” of the Main menu only lets the user to see the high score and “Exit” option to
									leave the game</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/androidApp01.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h2 class="major">OOP design</h2>
								<p>The gameObjectMgr class is basically the manager that controls all the gameObjects in the
									game. The manager adds or removes gameObjects from the two pools and the json files’ load.
									Therefore, that is why a new instance of this class is created in TheGame class every time that
									the user is ready to go into the next level. Furthermore, the AbstractGameObject class is
									extended by the GameObject class which has one more property as it can be collectable or not
									so it can get dirty (modified). The Pawn class extends the GameObject class by having three
									more properties (health, speed, isPlayer, canMove)</p>

						<!-- MATLAB GUI for image compression/decompression -->
						<article id="ImageCompDecomp">
							<h2 class="major">Overview
								<a href="https://github.com/pedroandreou/ImageCompDecomp">
									<i class="fa fa-github fa-2x"></i>
								 </a>
							</h2>
							<p>The program code is based on two image compression algorithms, DCT  and Huffman encoding using MATLAB programming langugage. 
								This approach was decided after reading a research on the benefits of these algorithms. 
								The DCT algorithm is Fourier-Transform based and is the most widely used algorithm for lossy compression. Most importantly, 
								it is one of the most efficient if not the most efficient compression method which is why it was implemented in the program. 
								Although RLE  seemed like a good choice over Huffman encoding, it is not as adaptable to multiple different types of input formats 
								and as the initial goal was to provide the user with that flexibility, 
								the focus was shifted to Huffman encoding and the research backed this claim. Last but not least, Huffman encoding provides a lossless type of data compression</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/img-comp-decomp.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h2 class="major">File Structure</h2>
							<p>The program consists of three m-files which are the script files that contain all the commands which will be executed. 
								The main m-file ,“Dashboard.m”, contains the code for the graphical user interface(GUI) and it is accompanied 
								by “Dashboard.fig” is the file the GUI will be displayed on.  In order to assist the readability of the program, 
								individual files were created for compression, “comp.m”, and decompression, “decomp.m”. When “Save Image” is pressed,
								 the program saves the image in PNG format</p>
							<h2 class="major">Exceptions</h2>
							<p>Ensuring that the users will have a good user experience means that the program should be prevented from throwing any exceptions/errors. 
								For that to be achieved, the buttons “Load Image”, “Compress Image”, “Decompress Image”, and “Save Image” were added where appropriate in the “Compression” 
								and “Decompression” sections of the GUI. It is important to note that if for example the user does not first load an image and immediately attempts 
								to compress/decompress/save, an appropriate warning message will pop up and help the user understand what should be done first.
								 The exception of the “Cancel” button being pressed in the Window Prompt while trying to load an image is also handled in the program.</p>
